During the meeting with the RegenTech representative, the organisational response strategy created by Skynet Research was discussed.

This discussion included a breakdown of the specific steps needed for RegenTech to take in order to achieve its organisational goals by updating their existing technologies and practices to the following:
- Implementation of drones for overhead imaging
- Installation of smart sensors and analysis of data obtained
- Implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

The strategy discussion covered expected disruption timelines, required personnel, key performance indicators as well as other anticipated organisational impacts.

The following questions were asked by the RegenTech organisational representative during the meeting:
- Should the video-conferencing trials be implemented to all of RegenTech's courses or only some?
- In which order should the three practices be implemented?
- What would be the risk if RegenTech did not begin implementing the strategies immediately?

These questions were answered and used to update the organisational response strategy where required.
