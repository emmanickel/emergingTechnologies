# Emerging Technology Report
### Emma Nickel
<br>
The purpose of this report is to identify and describe three emerging technologies and three emerging practices in the IT industry that are relevant to farm consulting company, RegenTech. 

<br>

## Information sources

Skynet Research consulted multiple different sources of information to discover relevant emerging technologies and practices. Aside from reputable websites found through the Google search engine, Government web articles were also considered, and the online journal, American Chemical Society (ACS) Publications, was consulted to gain expert knowledge on topics being researched.
Emerging Technology: Online video-conferencing platforms 
The emergence of new technologies that enable online video-conferencing for teaching and communication, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, have been developed to allow clients to easily run online courses. These platforms have experienced rapid growth in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic. These platforms generally offer affordable and have great UX design.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Implementation of video-conferencing to deliver short courses

The emerging technology of online video-conferencing software could be applied at RegenTech to efficiently run online versions of their free short courses. The classroom sessions could be made available both over live-stream and recorded to allow video playback, meaning farmers can complete the course according to his/her own time schedule.
This technology would allow the planning team to fulfill their five-year goal of 
- Finding a way to provide courses in a way that is more accessible to farmers

<br>

## Emerging Technology: Remote-controlled drones for satellite imaging

A drone is an ‘unmanned’ aircraft (formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles) that can either be controlled remotely or programmed to fly autonomously. While drones were first used for defence purposes in the 19th century, their commercial use was not permitted until 2006. Drones have many potential uses, but commercially they are commonly fitted with a camera allowing photography and videography.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Implementation of drone-imaging to replace helicopter photography

The emerging technology of drones could be applied to RegenTech by using them to conduct all farm photography and videography using remote-controlled drones fitted with cameras. The photos and videos can be taken remotely and accessed immediately, allowing more time for editing. Drone use would assist the planning team at RegenTech in achieving their goal of

- Reducing the need for helicopter photography.

Additionally, the reduced costs (in time both time and resources) associated with drones would allow more funding to be put towards the editing process, helping the visualisation team of the planning stream to fulfil the goal of 

- Creating immersive visualisations to help more farmers understand the benefits offered by RegenTech.

Drone use would also help the automation team to achieve their goal of 

- Reducing the time spent on a tractor, as they can be quickly flown to all areas of the farm and can carry payloads specific to the task at hand.

<br>

## Emerging Technology: Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to system refers to a network of devices transfer data via the internet. In the Agricultural IoT (Ag-IoT), these interconnected devices often consist of wireless sensors, radios and antennas that gather real-time data.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Installation of Ag-IoT and analysis of data obtained

The application of Ag-IoT to RegenTech would allow relevant real-time data on weather and soil conditions to be gathered. The installed sensors would eliminate the need for measurements to be taken by hand.  The data obtained using these devices could then be used to inform the operation of farm machinery, for example the current automated irrigation and liquid fertiliser systems. The electronically-stored data records can be analysed to observe meaningful long-term trends.
Installing and utilising Ag-IoT at RegenTech would help the automation team to achieve their goal of
- Improving their system’s capabilities to sense and adapt to changing weather conditions

Additionally, installing Ag-IoT at RegenTech would help the decision support team to achieve their goals of
- Finding a way to decrease labour cost associated with taking measurements
- Shortening the time taken for farmers to get data about their systems
- Providing farmers with data that is more meaningful
