# Organisational Response Strategy
### Emma Nickel

<br>

The current agricultural consulting services and systems in place at RegenTech are under significant threat due to the opportunities posed by emerging technologies and practices. RegenTech has identified 8 organisational goals across their three main streams which they aim to fulfil over the duration of a five year period in order to work towards creating 'smart farms' of the future:

**Planning stream goals:**
- *Find a way to provide courses in a way that is more accessible to farmers*
- *Reduce the need for helicopter photography*
- *Find better ways to create immersive visualizations to help more farmers understand the benefits offered by RegenTech.*

**Automation stream goals:** 
- *Improve their system's capabilities to sense and adapt to changing weather conditions*
- *Expand their operations to more areas of the farm such as reducing time spent driving a tractor.*

**Decision support stream goals:**
- *Find a way to decrease the labour cost associated with taking measurements*
- *Shorten the time it takes farmers to get data about their systems*
- *Provide the farmers with data that is more meaningful.*

<br>

Skynet Research believes that all of the above goals can be achieved through implementing relevant emerging technologies and practices. This Organisational Response Strategy will outline the steps required to assist RegenTech in achieving its goals.

## Implementation of drones for overhead imaging
The use of drones for overhead imaging has significant potential to change the current system of helicopter photography at RegenTech.

RegenTech should begin trials by purchasing a small number of drones to be used for capturing overhead imaging at existing client farms over a period of 6 months. These trials should be relatively inexpensive to conduct and would not jeopardise any potential client contracts. A small number of the RegenTech team should participate in a half-day training program during which they would learn how to effectively and legally operate the drones. The visualisation team of RegenTech's planning stream should then edit the content captured by the drones to create a visualisation of the client's farm using RegenTech's technologies. These visualisations could be compared to those previously created using the existing helicopter system. Feedback from all clients involved in the trial and the involved staff at RegenTech should be gathered.

After the 6 month trial period is complete, the feedback should be reviewed. If the majority of the feedback is positive, the trial will be deemed a success. The remaining number of required drones should then be purchased for use at RegenTech. The drone-operating team at RegenTech should be expanded accordingly and trained on their operation. Drone-imaging will then be implemented in all future dealings with both existing and prospective clients. RegenTech should work towards the goal of eliminating all helicopter use for photography by the end of the five year period. The resources saved through this new practice will in turn help to achieve RegenTech's goal of creating more immersive visualisations of client farms. 

If the majority of feedback is found to be negative, the trial should be deemed a failure. Any drones purchased for the trial should be repurposed to undertake other tasks on the farms, such as distributing fertiliser. Ongoing research monitoring any developments in the technology should be conducted. A review should be undertaken in one year increments with a view to either recommencing drone trials or adopting another emerging practice to address their goals.

## Installation of smart sensors and analysis of data obtained

The use of smart sensors connected via the Agricultural IoT to gather weather and soil data has significant potential to change the current system of manual data collection at RegenTech.

RegenTech should trial the use of smart sensors by offering a subsidised trial package to existing clients who choose to particpate in the program.
All required equipment should then be purchased for participating clients. A small team of personnel from RegenTech should undertake a single day training session to learn the installation and setup process of the smart sensor system. This team should then install trial sensor probes and configure software for appropriate data analysis. The participating clients must undertake a short online course offered by RegenTech (see the third practice outlined in this report) which explains how to operate and manage their new 'smart farm'. After the 1 year trial period, feedback from all clients engaged in the trial and the RegenTech staff involved should be obtained.

If the majority of feedback is positive, the trials will be considered successful. The new agricultural IoT system should be offered to all prospective clients (as well as existing clients who did not participate in the trial). RegenTech should aim to have converted all of their clients to 'smart-farms' by the end of the five year period. This long-term investment will eliminate the need to take manual measurements and ensure farmers obtain meaningful data in real-time. This in turn will reduce costs associated labour and resources, as well as support the use of adaptive machinery that responds to current conditions and minimises the time spent driving tractors.

If the feedback on the trials is mainly negative, the trial will be deemed a failure. Any equipment purchased for the trials should be repurposed or converted to manual operation where possible. Ongoing research monitoring developments in the technology should be conducted. A review should be undertaken in one year increments with a view recommencing trials.

## Implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

The emerging practice of delivering short courses via video-conferencing poses a significant threat to RegenTech's existing system of in-person delivery.

RegenTech should begin trialling courses over a widely-used platform such as *Zoom* for a one year period, upon purchasing a suitable membership plan.
Detailed student feedback should be collected in frequent increments throughout all courses conducted during the trial period. The feedback obtained should be regularly reviewed, and any relevant adjustments to the system should be made where possible. After the one year trial period, all student feedback should be reviewed, and feedback from RegenTech trainers shoudl also be gathered.

If the majority of the feedback is positive, the practice will be assumed a success. RegenTech should then continue to use video-conferencing for all of their courses indefinitely. They should continue monitoring feedback and make any necessary adjustments accordingly.

If the feedback obtained is predominantly negative, the trial will be deemed a failure. All courses at RegenTech should revert to their previous in-person system of delivery. Ongoing research monitoring any developments in emerging video-conferencing technologies should be conducted. Review should be undertaken in one year increments with a view to recommencing video-conferencing trials.

## Concluding summary

This organisational response strategy outlined the steps required for RegenTech to implement changes to their existing technologies and practices in order to move towards achieving their goals over the next five year period. As a result, RegenTech will be able to help create more efficient and sustainable farms of the future.
