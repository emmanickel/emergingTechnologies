RegenTech is a private technology company that provides consulting services to both farmers, as well as government agencies that work with farmers. Their aim is to develop technological solutions that allow farmers to adopt more sustainable and regenerative management practices.

RegenTech’s current issues are related to their:
- use of helicopters for overhead photography of clients’ farms
- delivery of their free short courses only via in-person format
- nonadaptive automated irrigation and fertiliser systems
- manual data-gathering process

This report will evaluate the impact of applying different practices based on emerging technologies at RegenTech.

## The use of drones for overhead imaging

Remote-controlled drones fitted with cameras could be used instead of helicopters at RegenTech to gain overhead photography and videography of clients’ farms. Drones are Relatively low in cost and lightweight, with the ability to pilot remotely would allow the visualisation team at RegenTech more funds and time to create a more immersive visualisation of the possibilities for each client.
Drones are relatively cheap to purchase, depending on size and the quality of the fitted camera. This would be a one-off purchase by RegenTech, and minimal maintenance would be required (apart from eventual replacement costs). The training involved would be minimal as drones are straightforward to use by any technologically literate person. Hence there would be limited drop in productivity over the transition from helicopter to drone use.
The cost of removing and replacing drone technology for overhead farm imaging would be insignificant, as it is likely that the drones could be repurposed to complete other tasks (e.g. distribute fertilisers). If necessary, drones that are in suitable condition could be sold. Since remote-controlling and photography using drones is an adaptable skill that requires minimal training, it is unlikely that staff would be disadvantaged in any way.
The differentiating factors are between drone and helicopter use for overhead imaging include the fact that drones are far cheaper and more versatile, as they can be used for many purposes other than photography. Additionally, helicopters use for overhead photography not only requires multiple personnel to be present which increases labour costs. 
All relevant drone laws would need to be researched and considered (for example, maximum permissible height).

## Installation of smart sensors and analysis of data obtained

Smart sensor devices interconnected via the Internet of Things can be offered by RegenTech to obtain real-time accurate data on weather and soil conditions. The linking of the sensors to the current automated irrigation and fertilisation operations would allow for more adaptive measures to be taken to efficiently manage resources. 
Smart sensor devices used to measure weather and soil conditions would be rather expensive to purchase. However, this would be a one-off expense for a farm. Installation costs would also need to be covered, upon selecting suitable locations for sensor placement. There would also be costs involved with setting up adequate software to store and analyse the data obtained appropriately. It is estimated that minimal training on how to use the software would be required once setup is complete.
Additionally, a farm could choose to minimise initial setup costs by replacing legacy machines with smart machines as replacements are required. 
Meanwhile, the cost to remove smart sensors would be expensive. Experts would be required to uninstall sensors and re-configure any equipment. However, considering the use of smart devices is increasing rapidly it is unlikely that this would be required. Additionally, it is expected that all of the smart machines could still be used manually if needed.
The differentiating factors between the current system of manual measurements and smart sensors is that it would eliminate the need for personnel to spend time recording measurements, thereby reducing labour costs. The potential for adaptive machinery based on data measurements would allow for better management of resources, leading to reduced wastage costs and more profits. Hence, while the initial installation costs would be significant for the smart sensor system, it would save money in the long term.
The potential regulatory and legal concerns brought about by Ag-IoT include ensuring the security and confidentiality of all data collected.

## Implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

Implementation of technologies such as Zoom for running RegenTech’s short courses would allow more farmers to participate and benefit from the resource.
The transition of RegenTech’s short courses to a virtual (or hybrid) experience would be affordable. Many video-conferencing services offer affordable membership plans for business use, and minimal setup and training would be required as many people are familiar with using these platforms. 
The cost of removal of hosting RegenTech’s courses via video-conferencing would be negligible.
The predominant differentiating factor of employing this technology is that it would allow more farmers to participate in RegenTech’s short courses, as they could log in remotely at a time that is suitable to them.
Potential legal and regulatory concerns that require consideration include maintaining the privacy of students as well as enforcing a code-of-conduct among course participants.
