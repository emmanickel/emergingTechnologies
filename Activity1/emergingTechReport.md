# Emerging Technology Report
### Emma Nickel
<br>
The purpose of this report is to identify and describe three emerging technologies and practices relevant to the farm consulting company, RegenTech. 

<br>

## Information sources

Skynet Research consulted multiple different sources of information to discover relevant emerging technologies and practices. Aside from reputable websites found through the Google search engine, government web articles were also considered. Additionally, the online journal: American Chemical Society (ACS) Publications was consulted to gain expert knowledge on topics being researched.

<br>

## Emerging Technology: Online video-conferencing software 

The emergence of video-conferencing software technologies, such as *Zoom* and *Microsoft Teams*, enable teaching and communication to be conducted online easily and efficiently. These platforms have experienced rapid growth in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and generally offer affordable membership plans with excellent UX design.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Implementation of video-conferencing to deliver short courses

The emerging technology of online video-conferencing software could be applied at RegenTech's short courses to allow remote students to participate. The course sessions could be recorded live, enabling participating farmers to complete the course according to his/her own time schedule.
The practice of this technology would allow the planning team of RegenTech to fulfill their five-year goal of finding a way to provide courses in a way that is more accessible to farmers.

<br>

## Emerging Technology: Drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)

A drone refers to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can be either controlled remotely or programmed to fly autonomously. While drones were first used for defence purposes in the 19th century, their commercial use was not permitted until 2006. Drones have many potential uses, however commercially they are commonly fitted with a camera to allow for photography and videography.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Implementation of drone-imaging to replace helicopter photography

Drones fitted with cameras could be used at RegenTech to conduct all overhead farm photography and videography of potential and current clients. Photos and videos taken using drones can be taken remotely and accessed almost immediately, reducing time and labour requirements. Drone use would assist the planning team at RegenTech in achieving their goal of reducing the need for helicopter photography. Additionally, the reduced costs (in time both time and resources) associated with drones would allow more funding to be put towards the editing process, helping the visualisation team of the planning stream to fulfil the goal of creating immersive visualisations to help more farmers understand the benefits offered by RegenTech. Drone use could also help the automation team to achieve their goal of reducing the time spent on a tractor, as they can be quickly flown to all areas of the farm and can carry payloads specific to the task at hand.

<br>

## Emerging Technology: Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to system refers to a network of devices transfer data via the internet. In the Agricultural IoT (Ag-IoT), these interconnected devices often consist of wireless sensors, radios and antennas that may gather real-time data on weather, crops, soil and livestock.

<br>

## Emerging Practice: Utilising Ag-IoT for data analysis

The application of Ag-IoT to RegenTech would allow relevant real-time data on weather and soil conditions to be gathered. The installed sensors would eliminate the need for measurements to be taken by hand. The data obtained using these devices could then be used to inform the operation of farm machinery, for example the current automated irrigation and liquid fertiliser systems. The electronically-stored data records could be analysed to observe meaningful short and long term trends. The installing and utilising Ag-IoT at RegenTech would help the automation team to achieve their goal of improving their system’s capabilities to sense and adapt to changing weather conditions. Additionally, installing Ag-IoT at RegenTech would help the decision support team to achieve their goals of finding a way to decrease labour cost associated with taking measurements, shortening the time taken for farmers to get data about their systems, and providing farmers with data that is more meaningful.
