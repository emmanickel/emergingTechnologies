RegenTech’s current issues relate to their:
- Use of helicopters for overhead photography of clients’ farms
- Delivery of their free short courses only via in-person format
- Nonadaptive automated irrigation and fertiliser systems
- Manual data-gathering process for weather and soil conditions

In order to solve the above issues, the following emerging technologies and practices have been considered for implementation at RegenTech:
1. The use of drones for overhead imaging
2. The installation of smart sensors connected via the Agricultural Internet of Things
3. The implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

## Implementation of drones for overhead imaging

- Remote-controlled drones fitted with cameras could be used instead of helicopters at RegenTech for overhead photography and videography. All captured content would be immediately accessible for editing to be conducted by the visualisation team.

- The cost of acquisition would be relatively low, as drones are cheap to purchase (depending on the size, quality and the fitted camera). This would be a one-off purchase by RegenTech, and no maintenance would be required (apart from eventual replacement costs). The training involved would be minimal as drones are straightforward to use. Hence there would be a negligible drop in productivity during RegenTech's transition from helicopter to drone use.

- The cost of removing the drone technology would be insignificant, as drones could be repurposed to complete other tasks, such as distributing fertilisers. Since the ability to operate these drones is an adaptable skill that requires minimal training, it is unlikely that any RegenTech staff would be disadvantaged if drone use was discontinued.

- The main differentiating factors between drones and helicopter are that drones are cheaper and can be controlled remotely, meaning that the drone-operator can be off-site and the content can be captured quickly. On the other hand, helicopter use is intensive in both time and cost. The use of drone imaging would allow RegenTech to focus more funding and labour toward editing the captured images and videos to create an immersive visualisation for each prospective client.

- Before implementing drone use, all relevant laws and regulations would need to be considered, including privacy issues and maximum permissible height of flight.

## Installation of smart sensors and analysis of data obtained

- Smart sensor devices interconnected via the Agricultural Internet of Things could be applied at RegenTech to obtain real-time accurate data on weather and soil conditions. The linking of real-time sensor data to the current automated irrigation and fertilisation operations would allow adaptive measures to be taken to efficiently manage resources. 

- The cost of acquiring high quality sensor probes for taking accurate measurements would be significant. Installation costs would also need to be covered, upon selecting suitable locations for sensor placement. There would also be costs involved with the setup of adequate software to appropriately analyse the data obtained. All of these costs would be a one-off expense for a farm. It is expected that minimal training on how to use the software would be required, leading to limited disruptions to productivity during the transition period. Additionally, a farm could choose to minimise initial setup costs by replacing legacy machines with smart machines as replacements are required. 

- Costs associated with the removal of smart sensors would include the labour to uninstall the sensors and re-configure any equipment. Considering the field of smart agricultural devices is expanding rapidly, it is unlikely that removal would be required. It is assumed that all of the smart machines could be used manually if needed.

- The differentiating factors between the use of smart sensors and the current system of manual measurements is that it would eliminate the need for personnel to spend time recording measurements, thereby reducing labour costs and any transcription errors. The implementation of adaptive machinery based on real-time data would allow for more efficient resource allocation. Hence, while the initial installation costs for smart sensor devices may be significant, it can be considered a good long-term investment.

- The potential legal considerations related to implementing smart agriculture involve ensuring the security and confidentiality of all data collected.

## Implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

- Implementation of technologies such as Zoom for running RegenTech’s short courses would allow more farmers to participate and benefit from the resource.

- The cost of transitioning RegenTech’s courses to a virtual (or hybrid) experience would be insignificant as many video-conferencing services offer affordable membership subscriptions for business use. Additionally, minimal setup and training would be required as many people are familiar with these platforms. 

- The cost of removal of hosting RegenTech’s courses via video-conferencing would be negligible.

- The predominant differentiating factor of employing this technology is that it would allow more farmers to participate in RegenTech’s short courses, as they could study remotely at a time suitable to them.

- Potential regulatory concerns include enforcing a code-of-conduct and ensuring the privacy of students is protected.
