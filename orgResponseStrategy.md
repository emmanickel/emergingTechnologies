# Organisational Response Strategy
### Emma Nickel
<br>

*Develop and document an organisational response strategy for how RegenTech could respond to emerging technologies and practices, and what changes to their existing technologies and practices would be required. Your report should include:*

<br>

The three main streams at RegenTech have identified the following goals to be achieved over a 5 year period:

**Planning stream**
- *Find a way to provide courses in a way that is more accessible to farmers*
- *Reduce the need for helicopter photography*
- *Find better ways to create immersive visualizations to help more farmers understand the benefits offered by RegenTech.*

**Automation stream** 
- *Improve their system's capabilities to sense and adapt to changing weather conditions*
- *Expand their operations to more areas of the farm such as reducing time spent driving a tractor.*

**Decision support stream**
- *Find a way to decrease the labour cost associated with taking measurements*
- *Shorten the time it takes farmers to get data about their systems*
- *Provide the farmers with data that is more meaningful.*

<br>

Skynet Research believes that all of the above goals can be achieved through implementing emerging technologies and practices at RegenTech. The following Organisational Response Strategy will outline the steps required to assist RegenTech in achieveing its goals.

## Implementation of drones for overhead imaging
The use of drones for overhead imaging has significant potential to change the current system of helicopter photography at RegenTech.

RegenTech should begin trials by purchasing a small number (e.g. 10) 
of drones to be used for capturing overhead imaging at existing client farms over a period of 6 months. These trials would be relatively inexpensive to conduct and would not jeopardise any potential client contracts. A small number of the RegenTech team would participate in a half-day training program during which they would learn how to effectively and legally operate the drones. The visualisation team of RegenTech's planning stream would then edit the captured content to create a visualisation of the client's farm using RegenTech's technologies. These visualisations could be compared to those previously created using the existing system. Feedback from both the clients involved in the trial as well as the staff at RegenTech would be gathered.

After the 6 month trial period is complete, the feedback would be reviewed. If the method is deemed successful, more drones would be purchased for use at RegenTech. More staff should be trained on their operation and their use should be implemented in all dealings with both existing and future clients. RegenTech should work towards a goal of eliminating all helicopter use for photography by the end of a five year period.

If the review of trial feedback is deemed a failure, any drones purchased would be repurposed to undertake other tasks on the farms, such as distributing fertiliser. Ongoing research monitoring any developments in the technology would be conducted. A review would be undertaken in one year increments with a view recommencing trials.

## Installation of smart sensors and analysis of data obtained

The use of smart sensors to gather weather and soil data has significant potential to change the current system of manual data collection.

Trials at RegenTech should begin by purchasing the required equipment for existing clients that choose to participate in the free trial program offered. A small team of personnel from RegenTech would undertake a single day training session on the installation and setup process of the smart sensors. This tean would then install trial sensor probes and configure software for appropriate data analysis. The participating clients must participate in a short online course offered by RegenTech (see the third strategy of this report) that explains how to operate and manage their new 'smart farm'. After a 1 year period, feedback from clients engaged in the trial and any RegenTech staff involved would be obtained.

If the trials are deemed to be successful, the smart agricultural IoT system will be offered to all new clients, with a goal of converting all to 'smart-farms' by the end of a five year period.

If the feedback on the trials deems the practice to be a failure, any equipment purchased for the trials will be converted to manual operation/repurposed where possible. Ongoing research monitoring any developments in the technology would be conducted. A review would be undertaken in one year increments with a view recommencing trials.

## Implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

The emerging practice of delivering online courses via video-conferencing poses a significant threat to RegenTech's existing system of in-person short courses.

RegenTech should begin trialling courses over a platform such as *Zoom* for a one year period, upon purchasing a suitable membership plan.
Student feedback should be collected extensively during all courses conducted during the trial period. After the one year period, all feedback will be reviewed, as well as feedback from trainers at RegenTech.

If the feedback proves the implemented practice to be a success, RegenTech should use video-conferencing for all of their courses indefinitely. They should continue taking and monitoring feedback and make any necessary adjustments accordingly.

If the review of trial feedback is deemed a failure, the courses at RegenTech will revert to their previous in-person system. Ongoing research monitoring any developments in the video-conferencing technology would be conducted. A review would be undertaken in one year increments with a view recommencing trials.

## Concluding summary

This organisational response strategy discussed the steps required for RegenTech to implement changes to their existing technologies and practices in order to move towards achieving their goals over the next five year period.

<br>



## A concluding summary

Need to cover the following points:
- A timeline for the disruption by the emerging technology or practice
- The personnel required to implement the strategy
- How different areas of the organisation will be influenced by the emerging solution
- Indicators that the strategy is working or failing
- A plan for responding to the emerging technology or practice to achieve organisational goals
- Linking the strategy back to the evaluation of the emerging technology or practice
- Linking the strategy back to the potential impacts of the emerging technology or practice

*You need to write your organisational response strategy in a markdown document and commit it to your repository.*
