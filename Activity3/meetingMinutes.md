During the meeting with RegenTech representative, the following three emerging technologies and practices under consideration were discussed:
- The use of drones for overhead imaging
- The installation of smart sensors connected via the Agricultural Internet of Things
- The implementation of video-conferencing platforms to enable the delivery of short courses

The impact of applying these emerging technologies and practices at RegenTech was discussed, specifically in relation to their:
- Cost of acquisition
- Cost of removal
- Differentiating factors
- Legal and regulatory concerns

During the meeting, the impact report developed by Skynet was shared with the RegenTech representative, who made the following queries:
- What would be the legal concerns relevant to drone use?
- What sort of training would be required for drone operation?
- What would be the installation costs and personnel required for the smart sensors?
- Would farmers need to be trained in how to use smart sensors?

These questions were responded to and used to update the existing impact report.
